Assignment 1: Python
The program read in a grammar from an input file. T
he grammar file contains the rules in Backus-Naur form
Each line from the file contains zero or more rules.
If the line has zero rule, it is considered as a blank line
and is ignored. All elements of the rule are separated by whitespaces to parse easily.
Once the program finishes reading the rules of the grammar,
the program prints out the parsed grammar and then
read in the userâ€™s sentence and print out the leftmost derivation (if existed) on the terminal.
